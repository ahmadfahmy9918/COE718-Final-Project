# COE718-Final-Project
We are tasked with creating an embedded application which performs multiple tasks, such as
calculating the summation of a first-order Maclaurin Series and will execute the corresponding task based on
user-input. We will implement Î¼Vision functionalities such as solving Priority Inversion using semaphores
and mutexes, and Joinable Threads to accomplish our goals in the most efficient manner possible while
maintaining these functionalities. 

Device Specs:
